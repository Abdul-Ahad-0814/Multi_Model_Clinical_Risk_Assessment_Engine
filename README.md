Overview

I decided to change that by building a Multi-Model Clinical Risk Assessment Engine—a tool that predicts the probability of Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Hypertension based on user health data.

This project merges machine learning, real-world health data, and modern web design to create an intuitive, interactive experience.

How It Works

1️⃣ Stage 1 Screening:
Users input general health info like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and lifestyle habits.
The system calculates risk probabilities for all three diseases and highlights the highest-risk disease.

2️⃣ Stage 2 Detailed Assessment:
Users provide additional, disease-specific information.
Fields already provided in Stage 1 are pre-filled automatically to avoid repetition.

3️⃣ Medical Insights & Disclaimer:
Each prediction comes with easy-to-understand medical notes and a clear disclaimer to ensure responsible usage.

4️⃣ Modern UI/UX:
The interface is designed to be visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly.

5️⃣ Deployment:
The app is live online via Flask and Render, ready for real-world testing.
